## About

With PostSharp you can simplify your code by moving frequently used actions into aspects.

## Requirements

* EPiServer 7.7+
* .Net 4.0
* PostSharp 4

## Deploy

* Add a reference to the project, or the compiled dll. Also add a reference to PostSharp
* Add the attributes for the desired aspect to your method, class or assembly.
* Build the solution.

## PostSharp

[PostSharp](http://www.postsharp.net/) has generously provided a license for this project. So there will be no need to install PostSharp yourself, the package is ofcourse still needed.
Let me know if this is not the case.
